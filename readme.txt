Tone.js Library - allows single notes and even chords to be used in functions 

letterFreak variable: based on letter frequency of main word entries in Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th edition, 1995)

Logic to allow rules to be enforced is stored in grid variable 

Frequent use of a second js file using node as a test area for logic

Unsolved Problems / Did't get to it yet: 
	-getting rules divs to toggle from being visible to being invisible 
 	-use key frames to have all the letter tiles flip over at the same time the tones play 
	-importing a dictionary library 


Rebuild from scratch?: 
	- variables are all centralized in one place in js
